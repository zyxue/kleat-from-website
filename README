CLEAT is designed to work on trans-ABySS output.
Specifically, the output of the following steps in trans-ABySS are used as input for CLEAT:

1. FEM (Filter-Extend-Merge) (single FASTA file)
2. GMAP contigs-to-genome alignment (single SAM file)
3. BWA-mem reads-to-contigs alignment (single BAM file)

In addition, annotation files are expected to be downloaded from UCSC and set up as instructed in the trans-ABySS manual.
This way, when <genome> (e.g. '-g hg19') is specified, the necessary annotation files can be retrieved handily.

CLEAT also requires 'BLAT' to align sequences to transcripts.  Make sure BLAT is in the PATH.

The identification of polyA tail from the assembly is performed by 'polyA.py'.
Here is an example of how to run 'polyA.py':

polyA.py -a aln.sam -c contigs.fa -g hg19 -o out.txt -b r2c.bam -r -e --use_tmp
 
-r = output read sequences that contain polyA tail
-e = overlap ESTs as evidence of cleavage site
--use_tmp = use /tmp space for holding BLAT alignments

A config file ('config.cfg') and a helper script ('run_polyA.py') are provided to run the pipeline in a SunGrid Engine cluster environment.
The idea is that multiple 'libraries' under a specific 'project' can be processed simultaneously, in the same theme of trans-ABySS.
The config file is encoded in the same format as those in trans-ABySS.

See the `analysis/README` for details on running scripts
